        subQuestion: "KYC or Know Your Customer is the process of identity verification.",
        answer: "Following Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, crypto exchanges should adopt a risk-based approach to KYC compliance. Risk-based compliance requires firms to perform risk-assessments of individual customers, and then implement a proportionate AML/CFT response. If an assessment finds that a customer is high risk, the crypto exchange should deploy more intensive compliance measures â€“ as opposed to simpler measures for low risk customers. Risk-based compliance enables crypto exchanges to deploy their AML/CFT resources more efficiently, while protecting customers from negative experiences, as far as possible."
